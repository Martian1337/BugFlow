# BugFlow

DevSecOps Pipeline for Secure Multi-language Applications Using Jenkins

## Overview

**BugFlow** is a beginner DevSecOps pipeline project designed to automate security checks throughout the software development lifecycle for multi-language applications, with integration to Jenkins. Pipelines like this helps teams shift security left by embedding static code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and best practices from planning to deployment.

## Features

- **Multi-language support:** Built to scan and secure diverse application stacks.
- **CI/CD integration:** Leverages Jenkins for automated validation and deployment.
- **Security automation:** Integrates vulnerability detection tools (SCA, SAST, container image scanning) in key pipeline stages.
- **Extensible:** Easily add or customize security tools for your stack.

## Pipeline Architecture

The BugFlow pipeline automates the following stages:

- **Code Analysis:** Scans code for security issues before building.
- **Dependency Checking:** Ensures third-party packages are vulnerability-free.
- **Build & Containerization:** Uses Jenkins to automate building and Docker image creation.
- **Image Scanning:** Scans built Docker images for known vulnerabilities.
- **Deployment:** Pushes validated images to registries after passing security checks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed and running
- Docker installed for containerization
- Access to a codebase (any language)
- Recommended: Install SAST/SCA tools for your stack

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Martian1337/BugFlow.git
```

Set up Jenkins jobs referencing the pipeline scripts contained in this repository.

Configure security tools and environment variables in Jenkins as needed.

### Usage

- Push code to your repository.
- Tailor code to your environment.
- Trigger a Jenkins pipeline build.
- Review security analysis results and fix any flagged vulnerabilities.
- Upon passing all stages, deploy artifacts as needed.
